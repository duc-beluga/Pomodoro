## Inspiration
As midterms approach, students often feel burnt out from long study sessions. The Pomodoro Technique offers a solution to maintain focus and study efficiently.
## What it does
Our website automates the Pomodoro Technique, alternating between 25-minute study periods and 5-minute breaks. Users can also login and logout in order to record their sessions. 
## How we built it
We used React for the frontend, integrating Lucide icons and Axios for data fetching, and react-hook-form for form handling. The backend is powered by Express with Passport.js for authentication, using express-session and GitHubStrategy.
## Challenges we ran into
Implementing authentication with Passport.js was challenging, especially handling sessions and cookies.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully integrated GitHub OAuth for user authentication and added features like loop videos, timed audios, and gradient backgrounds.
## What we learned
The project enhanced our understanding of code organization, responsibility separation, and encapsulation.
## What's next for POMODORO
This app has so much potentials.
We plan to expand the app's capabilities with D3.js to visualize user activity, integrate a music player for study sessions, and add a to-do list feature.
